Q: Why do you not want to become an engineer?
A: Engineering traditionally and currently is a mature, semi-professional field with little flexibility hemmed in by fierce competition and harsh regulations. It is rarely thought, at least in it's modern sense, as the artform of problem-solving. For me, the one whos intrested in the latter rather than the former, it makes perfect sense to pursue a degree which lets me prep myself for an unforseeable future.
